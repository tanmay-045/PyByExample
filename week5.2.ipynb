    "### Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is a technique in programming that allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making the most of modern multi-core processors. It's like having multiple workers (threads) in your program, each doing a different job.<br><br>\n",
    "In Python, it's especially useful for tasks that can be split into smaller, independent parts that can run concurrently. For example, we might use multithreading for:<br>\n",
    "1.Downloading multiple files simultaneously.<br>\n",
    "2.Processing data in the background while keeping the main program responsive.<br>\n",
    "3.Running tasks concurrently in a web server to handle multiple client requests.<br><br>\n",

    "### Q2. Why threading module used? Write the use of the following functions:-\n",
    "## 1. activeCount()\n",
    "## 2. currentThread()\n",
    "## 3. enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module in Python is essential for implementing multithreading, allowing concurrent execution of tasks within the same process. Threads run independently, sharing resources and improving program performance. While beneficial for I/O-bound operations and enhancing responsiveness in UI applications, Python's Global Interpreter Lock restricts true parallel execution. The module provides tools for creating, managing, and synchronizing threads, enabling modularity and resource sharing.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. activeCount()<br>\n",
    "The activeCount() method in the threading module in Python is used to retrieve the current number of Thread objects that are currently alive. A \"live\" thread is a thread that has been created and has not yet terminated. This method provides a count of the threads that are actively running or are in a runnable state.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. currentThread()<br>\n",
    "The currentThread() method in the threading module in Python is used to obtain a reference to the current Thread object, representing the thread that the method is called from. This method is useful for obtaining information about the currently executing thread, such as its name or identifier.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. enumerate()<br>\n",
    "Return a list of all Thread objects currently active. The list includes daemonic threads and dummy thread objects created by current_thread(). It excludes terminated threads and threads that have not yet been started. However, the main thread is always part of the result, even when terminated."

    "\n",
    "### Deadlocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A deadlock is a situation in multithreading where two or more threads are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causes:**\n",
    "1. **Circular Waiting:** Threads hold resources and wait for others in a circular chain.\n",
    "2. **No Preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread; they must be released voluntarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "- Thread A holds Resource 1 and requests Resource 2.\n",
    "- Thread B holds Resource 2 and requests Resource 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Both threads are waiting for a resource that the other holds, leading to a perpetual wait state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Race Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the order of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Causes:**\n",
    "1. **Non-Atomic Operations:** Operations involving shared data are not atomic (indivisible).\n",
    "2. **Lack of Synchronization:** No proper synchronization mechanisms to control access to shared resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Scenario:**\n",
    "- Two threads concurrently increment a shared counter without proper synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** The final value of the counter may not be the expected sum, as increments may overlap, leading to data inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deadlocks:** Threads are stuck in a cyclic waiting state due to resource contention.\n",
    "- **Race Conditions:** Unpredictable outcomes arise from concurrent access to shared data without proper synchronization.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions can introduce bugs and unexpected behavior in multithreaded programs. Mitigating these issues requires careful synchronization and resource management in the code"
